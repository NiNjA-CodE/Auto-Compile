Program targets java, c, or c++ programs to compile. Compiles programs stored in snips but can be changed in source code. Execute program by adding arguments after running. CPP, C, or Java

i.e. >$ java Compile CPP
     >$ java Compile C
     
     etc...
     
     Final output of the program simply takes the error output from attempted compile and outputs to 'final' in a shorter, easier to read format.
